# Advent of Code 2018

Here are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge for 2018.

Input to the solutions exist in the input/ directory and the solutions in the solutions/ directory. All of the problem explanations exist commented out above the solution code for that problem. Just open any of the js files.

To run any of the solutions, just clone the project and run the following for any of the days, in this example, the solution for day 1:

`node solutions/day01.js`

and it will output the answer, in this case:

`430`
